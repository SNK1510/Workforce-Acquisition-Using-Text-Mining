# Workforce Acquisition Using Text Mining
The inspiration for this project is the situation most of us are in, international students in the job market in the USA. There is an imbalance between the number of jobs created and the number of graduates every year and this is the reason for fierce competition in job applications. Every job posting has hundreds of job applications. For a company that has multiple job postings, it is the number of job postings times the hundreds of applications. It is practically an impossible task to go through every application to find the best person for the job.

While wait times and rejections are all situations we face as students, being on the other hand as a recruiter is no jolly ride either. To deal with all the applications and resumes that come through, to go through documents and identify suitable candidates is a mammoth task. 

In this project is a simple tool that works on two data sets - The resume dataset and the Job description dataset to find the best possible resume matches for each Job Description (JD)
